## A little summary of me

- Using **docker** and **docker-compose** since 2017.
- For orchrestration I prefer to use **Kubernetes**, I also have experience using **Nomad**.
- As a cloud provider, my biggest experience is using **AWS**, but I also managed an **Azure** infrastructure.

- I like automating infrastructure creation, configuration and maintaining with **terraform**. I also have experience using **ansible**.
- I have experience not only using CI/CD tools like **Jenkins**, **Github Actions**, **Buildkite**, but also managing their infrastructure, and maintaining pipelines.
- I believe that **automatization** and **git** are a must when working in an engineering team: Making manual changes will probably lead the team to break things and don't understand why.
- I believe in taking *data-driven* decisions, so, I think that **observability** is a key for a healthy infrastructure and making the right choices.
- I'm curious about **new technologies** in general and like to learn new languages and tools in order to make life easier.
- Especially curious about **Linux** and **open source** since I was a child.
- I like to establish good relationships with my **co-workers**, I believe that work is an important part of my life, and I made good **friends** in my career. I'm a **empathic**, **responsible** person.
- I like **challenges**, and I don't have a problem assuming **risks**.

I also maintained the reliability of the platform that runs in Nomad clusters in AWS, by using Terraform and Ansible.
I contributed isolating environments to each other, automating processes like users onboard/offboard, adding more tests for our automations, improving the internal infrastructure by adding a docker mirror in our cluster, creating android emulators that run in docker containers in our same VPC, to run E2E tests, enabling observability for applications that didn't have before.
